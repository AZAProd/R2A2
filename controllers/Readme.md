These are various programs to use as controllers, interfacing with r2 control.

Ideas are:

Wiimote - Use a nunchuck as the main forward/back/dome control.
PS3 - Controls over bluetooth rather than an xbee as the standard PS2 controller.
WWW - Web based control from tablet or mobile (or computer). Allows all sorts of custom control, but not good for steering.
